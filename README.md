When referring to **registration**, it can apply to a variety of contexts, so here are some common scenarios where registration is involved:

### 1. **Event Registration**
   - **Context**: This refers to the process of signing up to attend or participate in an event, such as a conference, seminar, or workshop. Registration typically involves filling out a form with personal details (name, email, etc.) and sometimes paying a fee. It ensures that the event organizers know how many people are attending, and it may also help with managing resources (e.g., seats, materials, food).
   - **Example**: You need to register for a tech conference by filling out an online form. Once registered, you may receive a confirmation email with further details.

### 2. **Course or Class Registration**
   - **Context**: In academic or educational settings, registration refers to the process by which students enroll in specific courses for a semester or term. This usually involves selecting courses, verifying prerequisites, and confirming schedule preferences. Some systems also allow students to add or drop courses within a certain window.
